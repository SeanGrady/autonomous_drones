To buy: 
-Female end of the battery connector (Venom one)
-Male end of the power supply (for Navio)



FINDINGS:
-Using a really rough implementation of the gas dispersion model in [1], gradient descent is easy. However, add the slightest bit of noise, and it's almost impossible until you find the plume. 



TODO:
-Fix waypoints
-Integrate iperf measurements
--Log iperf with gps
--Make that plot


-Show a map with the plot
-Better dispersion model. Maybe look into AERMOD
-Find a way to get altitude in AGL. We will need this in case the drone needs to navigate around hills or steep terrain. It most likely involves downloading a map, although a rangefinder could also be used. 

-Characterize gas dispersion by taking measurements. That is:
--How much does it vary with time? I'd place some sensors at a fixed position near a known source and let it run for a long time. 
--What does the plume look like? Take a ton of measurements in a grid around a known source. 
--Model the dispersion
--Find out if we can do gradient ascent on it
